<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"Hello World, I'm Pallavi Gupta, a frontend developer fueled by boundless creativity and an insatiable thirst for learning.
With a creative mindset and attention to detail, I approach each project as a canvas for innovation. <img height="200" src="../assets/images/IMG20240109173441.jpg" alt="Pallavi"> 
On the technical side, I'm equally passionate about optimizing code for efficiency and reliability.</p>
<p>Beyond the screen, I'm an extrovert at heart who loves nothing more than connecting with others and exchanging ideas. Whether it's discussing the latest tech trends over coffee or sharing travel stories from far-flung destinations, I believe that meaningful conversations are where inspiration thrives.</p>

<p>Speaking of travel, I'm a true wanderlust at heart, always seeking out new adventures and immersing myself in diverse cultures. I find inspiration in the sights, sounds, and flavors of the world, bringing a global perspective to my work and infusing it with fresh insights and ideas.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding or jet-setting to new destinations, you can find me exploring local art galleries, attending meetups to expand my network, or volunteering in my community. I believe in the power of community and collaboration to drive positive change, both in the digital realm and beyond.</p>
<p>I'm excited to connect with fellow creatives, curious minds, and passionate collaborators who share my love for frontend development and the endless possibilities it holds. Let's embark on this journey together and create something truly extraordinary!" Like below &#128521</p>
